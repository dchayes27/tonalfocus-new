 * @description Barrel file for the Logo component.
 * This file re-exports the default export from 'Logo.tsx',
 * allowing for cleaner imports in other parts of the application.
 *
 * For example, instead of:
 * `import Logo from '@/components/ui/logo/Logo';`
 * You can use:
 * `import Logo from '@/components/ui/logo';`
