# WARNING: This is a potentially destructive script.
# It completely removes the existing Git history (.git directory),
# reinitializes the repository, commits all current files as a new
# initial commit, and force pushes to the 'main' branch of the
# specified remote repository.
#
# USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION. This is typically used for starting a project
# over with a clean Git history while preserving the current file state.
#
# Ensure the remote repository URL is correct before running.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
