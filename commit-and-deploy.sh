# pushing them to the 'main' branch on GitHub, and then deploying the
# application to Vercel for production.

# Note: This script uses a hardcoded commit message. For more flexible use,
# consider parameterizing the commit message or prompting the user for one.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
