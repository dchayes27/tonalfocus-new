# --------------
# This script stages all current changes, commits them with a (currently hardcoded)
# message, and then force pushes the 'main' branch to the GitHub remote 'origin'.
#
# WARNING: This script uses 'git push -f' (force push).
# Force pushing overwrites the remote history and should be used with caution,
# especially in collaborative environments. It's used here to ensure the remote
# strictly mirrors the local 'main' branch after this operation.
#
# Note: The commit message is hardcoded. For more general use, consider
# parameterizing it or prompting the user.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

# This ensures that the remote 'main' branch exactly matches the local 'main' branch.
